# Mock Data Replacement Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive replacement of mock data with actual API calls to the database (Supabase) across the TerraTrain application.

## Files Modified

### 1. API Routes Created

#### `/app/api/bounties/[id]/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Handle individual bounty operations (GET, PUT, DELETE)
- **Features**:
  - Fetch single bounty by ID with creator profile
  - Update bounty (creator only)
  - Delete bounty (creator only)
  - Proper error handling and authorization

#### `/app/api/datasets/[id]/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Handle individual dataset operations (GET, PUT, DELETE)
- **Features**:
  - Fetch single dataset by ID with creator profile
  - Update dataset (creator only)
  - Delete dataset (creator only)
  - Proper error handling and authorization

#### `/app/api/dashboard/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Provide comprehensive dashboard data for authenticated users
- **Features**:
  - User statistics (submissions, earnings, approval rate)
  - Recent submissions with bounty details
  - Active bounties user has contributed to
  - Contributor rank calculation
  - Profile integration

### 2. Frontend Pages Updated

#### `/app/bounties/page.tsx`
- **Changes**: Replaced hardcoded bounty array with API calls
- **Features**:
  - Real-time data fetching from `/api/bounties`
  - Loading states with skeleton UI
  - Error handling with retry functionality
  - Client-side filtering and sorting
  - Search functionality
  - Category and difficulty filters

#### `/app/bounties/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Changes**: Replaced mock bounty data with dynamic API call
- **Features**:
  - Fetch individual bounty by ID
  - Loading and error states
  - Graceful handling of missing bounties
  - Creator profile display
  - Conditional rendering of optional fields

#### `/app/marketplace/page.tsx`
- **Changes**: Replaced hardcoded dataset array with API calls
- **Features**:
  - Real-time data fetching from `/api/datasets`
  - Loading states with skeleton UI
  - Error handling with retry functionality
  - Client-side filtering and sorting
  - Search functionality
  - Category filtering

#### `/app/marketplace/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Changes**: Replaced mock dataset data with dynamic API call
- **Features**:
  - Fetch individual dataset by ID
  - Loading and error states
  - Graceful handling of missing datasets
  - Conditional rendering of optional metadata
  - Purchase functionality integration

#### `/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- **Changes**: Replaced mock user data with comprehensive API integration
- **Features**:
  - Real-time dashboard data from `/api/dashboard`
  - Authentication-aware rendering
  - Loading and error states
  - Dynamic statistics calculation
  - Recent submissions display
  - Active bounties tracking

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow Architecture

1. **Client Components**: All pages converted to "use client" for state management
2. **API Integration**: Fetch calls to respective API endpoints
3. **State Management**: useState hooks for data, loading, and error states
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback
5. **Loading States**: Skeleton UI components during data fetching

### Type Safety

- **Interfaces Defined**: Strong TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- **Component Compatibility**: Interfaces aligned with existing component expectations
- **API Response Types**: Proper typing for API responses and error handling

### Performance Optimizations

- **Conditional Rendering**: Components only render when data is available
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful degradation on API failures
- **Loading States**: Immediate UI feedback during data fetching
- **Retry Mechanisms**: User can retry failed API calls

## Database Schema Assumptions

Based on the API implementation, the following database schema is assumed:

### Tables
- `bounties`: id, title, description, reward, videos_needed, videos_submitted, category, difficulty, duration, requirements, creator_id, status, posted_date, expiry_date
- `datasets`: id, title, description, price, video_count, contributors, category, format, size, license, tags, features, use_cases, creator_id, status
- `submissions`: id, bounty_id, contributor_id, status, created_at, rejection_reason
- `profiles`: id, display_name, avatar_url, created_at

### Relationships
- bounties → profiles (creator_id)
- datasets → profiles (creator_id)
- submissions → bounties (bounty_id)
- submissions → profiles (contributor_id)

## Error Handling Strategy

### Frontend
- Loading states during API calls
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry functionality for failed requests
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data

### Backend
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed error messages
- Authorization checks
- Input validation

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Real-time Data**: All data now comes from the live database
2. **Scalability**: Application can handle dynamic data changes
3. **User Experience**: Loading states and error handling improve UX
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized API endpoints for data management
5. **Security**: Proper authorization checks on all endpoints
6. **Performance**: Efficient data fetching with proper error handling

## Future Considerations

1. **Caching**: Implement client-side caching for frequently accessed data
2. **Real-time Updates**: Consider WebSocket integration for live updates
3. **Pagination**: Add pagination for large datasets
4. **Optimistic Updates**: Implement optimistic UI updates for better perceived performance
5. **Data Validation**: Add client-side form validation for data submissions

## Testing Recommendations

1. **API Testing**: Test all endpoints with various scenarios
2. **Error Scenarios**: Test network failures, unauthorized access, missing data
3. **Loading States**: Verify loading UI appears correctly
4. **Data Consistency**: Ensure UI reflects actual database state
5. **Performance**: Monitor API response times and optimize as needed

## Migration Notes

- All mock data has been completely removed
- Existing component interfaces maintained for compatibility
- No breaking changes to component props
- Smooth transition from static to dynamic data
- Backward compatibility maintained during the migration process
