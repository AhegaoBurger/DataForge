-- Setup PRIVATE video storage with proper RLS policies
-- This is more secure and gives better control over video access

-- Policy 5: Allow contributors to delete their own pending/rejected videos
CREATE POLICY "Contributors can delete their own videos"

-- VERIFICATION QUERIES
-- ============================================================================

-- Verify the bucket configuration
SELECT

-- List all policies for verification
SELECT

-- ============================================================================
-- NOTES
-- ============================================================================
--
-- With a PRIVATE bucket:
-- 1. Videos are only accessible to authorized users based on RLS policies
-- 2. You get signed URLs from Supabase that expire after a set time
-- 3. Better security - can't guess URLs to access videos
-- 4. More control over who sees what
--
-- To get video URLs in your code, use:
--   const { data } = supabase.storage
--     .from('videos')
--     .createSignedUrl(fileName, 3600) // Expires in 1 hour
--
-- Or for authenticated access:
--   const { data: { publicUrl } } = supabase.storage
--     .from('videos')
--     .getPublicUrl(fileName) // Works with RLS policies
--
